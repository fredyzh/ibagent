/**
 * Represents the public holidays as declared in Federal law (5 U.S.C. 6103). All dates listed in section (a) are
 * enumerated. Inauguration day, which is described in section (c) is not enumerated, but is accounted for in the
 * static {@link #observancesForYear} and {@link #isObserved(LocalDate)} methods.
 * <p>
 * Fixed holidays that fall on specific days each year (e.g. Christmas) are observed on the nearest work day. If the
 * actual holiday is on a Saturday, the observance occurs on the Friday before; if the holiday is on a Sunday, the
 * observance occurs on the Monday after. The dates used for such fixed holidays will be the observed dates and not
 * the actual ones.
 * <p>
 * This method does not account for historical changes in Federal law regarding Holidays and should not be used to
 * determine holidays in the past, such as Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday for years prior to 1983, when the
 * observance was formally adopted.
